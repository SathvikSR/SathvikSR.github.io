#### "The thing about goals is that living without them is a lot more fun, in the short run. It seems to me, though, that the people who get things done, who lead, who grow and who make an impactâ€¦ those people have goals" - Seth Godin.

It has been about 2 months into 2020 and I'm feeling so productive.

In 2019, I had made a similar "Goals" list on a piece of paper, on which I procrastinated hard. My previous list had a lot of goals from **very** diverse areas of study, which I suspect was the cause of not achieving them.
2020 is going to be different.
